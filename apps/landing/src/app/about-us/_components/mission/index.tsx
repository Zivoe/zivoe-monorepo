          Zivoe (“z-eye-voh”) is a Balkan word meaning “to life,” reflecting our belief that finance should improve life, not limit it. 
          We are modernizing private credit by connecting on-chain capital to real-world lending opportunities with greater transparency, access, and efficiency. 
          By building open financial infrastructure that enables sustainable yield and expands credit access to underserved markets, 
          Zivoe is reshaping how capital moves across the global lending landscape.
